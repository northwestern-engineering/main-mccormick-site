You’ll go back to the **Move page** screen where you’ll see **New Folder** field populated with the new folder that you just selected.

* Check **Un-publish Content** to remove the page from its original location on the live site as well as Cascade. **IMPORTANT**: If you do not check this box, a copy of the page will remain in its original location on the live site with no way to edit it in the future.

To move **multiple** folders or files at once:

* * Click on the parent folder of the asset\(s\)
  * Check the boxes of those you want to Move
  * In the top box menu, select **Move**
  * Specify the new location of the asset\(s\)

**\*NOTE:** There is no way to un-publish files from their original location while moving multiple files at once. Files should be un-published first by selecting PublishUn-publish.

**\*\*NOTE:** If you’re moving an asset that has been on the live site for a while, you might consider planning a redirect from the old url to the new url. Contact web-updates@mccormick.northwestern.edu if you need help with this step.
