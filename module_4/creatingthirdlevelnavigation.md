## Creating Third-Level Navigation {#creating-third-level-navigation}

The website template used by McCormick allows for the left-hand navigation to display up to three levels at once, which enables you to better organize areas with a large amount of content.

If you would like to create a third level of navigation, create a new folder inside one of your other folders. Then repeat the steps above to create a new section folder and addition pages as needed.

**NOTE:** You will need to publish all folders affected by your changes in order for the left-hand navigation on your website to reflect the latest updates.
