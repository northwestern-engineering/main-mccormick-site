## Basic Formatting {#basic-formatting}

Formatting text as bold, italic, underline, and setting its alignment to left, right, or justified, works the same in Cascade as it does in any word processor: Simply select the appropriate text, then apply the formatting you want it to have.

**NOTE:** Cascade is currently configured to remove the “centered” formatting available in the WYSIWYG editor. If you want to center-align any text, use the “Formats” drop-down menu as explained earlier.
