## Publishing the Entire Website {#publishing-the-entire-website}

When you update a common element, such as your top navigation or the footer, you must publish the entire website. To publish the entire site:

1.  Locate and click the root directory in the navigation panel or folder tree. It could be name **Home** or the name of your site.
