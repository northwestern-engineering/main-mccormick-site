### My Content Widget {#my-content-widget}

You’ll find a list of recently clicked assets under **Recent**, saved drafts under **Drafts** and assets that you’ve checked out to yourself under **Locks**. Most of our sites don’t have Workflows. Just switch to the appropriate subtab to see the relevant content.

By default, Recent is displayed in the My Content section at the center of the Dashboard. There are other ways to get access to Recent.

### Stale Content Widget {#stale-content-widget}

Stale content widget shows you when the site content was last updated. If you’re logging in for the first time, click the pencil icon in the top right corner to select your site and set the time period to determine content staleness.

If you expand **Filter Results** option, you’ll see the options to change the number of days and include the folder you need to routinely update. In this way, you can exclude sections that don’t get updated often.
