What’s an Asset?

In Cascade, the word “asset” is a blanket term for **any object loaded into, or created in, the Content Management System.**

An asset can refer to:

| • a web page | • an image file (photo) | • a folder |
| --- | --- | --- |
| • a PDF | • an MS Word document | • an MS Excel document |
| • an external link | • an internal link |  |

### Naming Files, Folders, and Webpage Assets {#naming-files-folders-and-webpage-assets}

Since asset filenames become part of their URL addresses and also affect how readily your website appears in search results, it is important to follow certain conventions as you name your assets in Cascade.

When providing the **Asset Name** in Cascade, please follow these guidelines:

*   Asset Names should not contain any spaces and should not be unnecessarily long.
*   They should use keywords, all lowercase, separated by hyphens.
*   They should not include dates that will expire.

**Here are examples of good and bad Asset Names:**

| **GOOD** | **BAD** |
