## Editing Index Pages {#editing-index-pages}

Once your section folder is created, you’ll notice an “index” page inside it. The index page is the webpage that a browser automatically displays when a visitor navigates to a folder. It’s the default or “start page” for visitors to that section of your website.

* From the preview window of the index page, go to the **Edit** option.

The **Display Name of the folder**, rather than the index page, will appear in the breadcrumbs and left-hand navigation of your website. The **Title** will appear at the top of the content area of your page and also in the browser’s title bar.
