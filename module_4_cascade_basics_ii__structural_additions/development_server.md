## Development Server {#development-server}

The McCormick site has a development environment which is essentially a copy of the entire site accessible at [http://mccormick-dev.tech.northwestern.edu](http://mccormick-dev.tech.northwestern.edu). This location is not indexed by Google and can only be accessed by sharing its url.

The development server can be useful for publishing pages for others to review who do not have access to Cascade before making that page live. See more details on this in the &quot;[Publishing Your Webpages](../module_2_editing_a_basic_page/submit_vs_publish.md#115333639914907-_Publishing_Your_Webpages)&quot; section of this guide.
