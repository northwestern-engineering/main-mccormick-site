## Submit Vs. Publish {#submit-vs-publish}

Submitting a page or asset saves that version in Cascade and allows other users to view your changes. When you return to that page or file in Cascade, even after logging out of the system, it will display the most recent updates that were submitted. **However, submitting does NOT put your pages or files on the web. You must publish them.**

**Publishing** is the process by which your pages, folders, or other assets are copied from Cascade and put onto one of McCormickâ€™s public web servers. Publishing a page, folder, or other asset, **makes that content visible on the web.** Conversely, un-publishing removes content from the web.
