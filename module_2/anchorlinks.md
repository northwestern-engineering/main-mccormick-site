## Anchor Links {#anchor-links}

Anchors allow you to mark specific points anywhere on your webpage that can be linked to from external pages. For example, using an anchor link, it would be possible to link to, say, the third paragraph of a page, rather than the top of that page.

Important!

1. Anchor names should be treated as Asset Names:

Use lowercase keywords separated by hyphens. Do not use spaces or special characters in your anchors.

1. Keep close track of your anchor link names!

Cascade’s system for linking to anchors in a page does not provide a list of anchors to choose from - you have to enter the anchor name yourself. If the anchor name you enter isn’t exactly right, the link won’t work!

1. Always test your anchor links after publishing them.

If you find problems, it’ll be much easier to correct them immediately than it would be hours or days later.

They are most often used on Web pages with a large amount of content, as they offer the ability to go directly to a single piece of content rather than scrolling down through the entire page. For example, the “back to top” links often used in long lists are actually pointing to the same page anchor at the top of the page.

**To insert an anchor:**

1. Go to the area of the page where you want the anchor to be \(usually near a heading\) and click the anchor tool.
2. Enter an anchor id \(name\) and click “Ok.” **Anchor names must start with a letter** and cannot include spaces.
3. When you want to link to that specific section from a table of contents at the top of the page:
   1. Use the link tool as you would for an ordinary link, but rather than choosing an external page to link to, enter the name of the anchor link on the current page.
4. When you want to link to an anchor on a page **other than the one you’re currently editing:**
   1. Use the Link tool to select the page elsewhere in the site.
   2. Enter the name of the anchor link on that page in the “Anchor” field.
