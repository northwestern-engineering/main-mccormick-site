## Mark Content for Review {#mark-content-for-review}

You can mark your assets for review if you want to update the information on a regular basis or on a certain date. Assets that are marked for review will be listed you your dashboard under **Content to Review** section. To do this, follow the steps below:

1. Go to the site and select the asset you want to mark for review.
2. In the preview window, locate and click on **Edit**. This opens a new window.
3. In the next window, switch to **Metadata** tab. Scroll down to enter a review date and click **Save and Preview** button to save a draft. On the next screen, you’ll see the option to **Submit**. You don’t need to publish the asset after this step.
